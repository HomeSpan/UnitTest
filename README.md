# UnitTest
Unit Regression Tests for HomeSpan.  Purpose is to test various features and functions of [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) across all supported chips (ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-C3) to ensure changes made to new version of the library do not inadvertently break existing functionality.

These sketches are for on-going, internal, development use and may or may not compile under the current production release of HomeSpan if they are being used to test a new version under active development.
