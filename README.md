# UnitTest
Unit Regression Tests for HomeSpan.  Purpose is to test various features and functions of [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) across all three supported chips (ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-C3) to ensure changes made to new version of the library do not inadvertently break existing functionality.

This sketch is for on-going, internal, development use and may or may not compile under the current production release of HomeSpan if it is being used to test a new version under active development.  At some point in the future UnitTest itself may become versioned to track HomeSpan releases.
